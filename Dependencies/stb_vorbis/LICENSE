Public Domain "license"

I, Sean Barrett, single-handedly wrote the decoder, and as the legal author (it was not a "work for hire") placed it in the public domain in April, 2007. That means I have disclaimed copyright of it. You can take the source code and use it for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, copyrighted, open-source, Free, free, or public domain, with no legal obligation to acknowledge the borrowing/copying in any way.
